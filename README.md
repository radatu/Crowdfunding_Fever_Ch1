# Crowdfunding-Fever

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis is to visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and funding goals of the Kickstarter dataset. This will help Louise to determine how different campaigns performed in relation to their launch dates and funding goals.
### Limitation of Scope
For the purposes of the exploration of this dataset, Deliverable 1 was limited to crowdfunding for the "Theater" Parent Category while Deliverable 2 was limited to the "plays" subcategory. It would have been interesting to see whether other domains such as film was more conducive to crowdfunding or not but this was out of scope for the project.

## Analysis and Challenges
The analysis is divided into two sections: Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date and Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals. To perform the analysis, we first imported the Kickstarter dataset into Microsoft Excel and then created pivot tables to summarize the data. We then created line charts to visualize the outcomes by launch date and a stacked column chart to visualize the outcomes by goals.

One of the challenges encountered during the analysis was trying to look to see if there were genuine seasonal trends by filtering the data by month over a few years. There is always the possibility that some seasonal trends are disrupted during a particular year, affecting the accuracy of the results. An exaample of this in recent history is how all societal and seasonal trends were disrupted by the ensuing of the COVID-19 pandemic in March of 2020, effectively changing much societal and seasonal behavior for at least the next two years, if not permanently.

## Results
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Two conclusions can be drawn about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date:

The month of May had the highest number of successful theater campaigns while December had the lowest number of successful campaigns.
There was a general trend of more successful campaigns than failed campaigns throughout the year, with a slight dip in October and a significant dip in December.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Based on the outcomes by goals:

Campaigns with lower goals (less than 1000) had a higher percentage of failed campaigns than those with higher goals (5000 or more).
Campaigns with higher goals (5000 or more) had a higher percentage of successful campaigns than those with lower goals.

### Limitations of the Dataset
Some limitations of the dataset include:

The data is limited to Kickstarter campaigns only and does not reflect campaigns from other crowdfunding platforms.
The data is not a complete representation of all Kickstarter campaigns as some campaigns may not have been included in the dataset.

### Other Possible Tables and/or Graphs
Other possible tables and graphs that can be created include:

A table showing the relationship between the outcomes and the duration of the campaign.
A table showing the relationship between the outcomes and the category of the campaign.
A scatter plot showing the relationship between the backers and the pledged amount.
